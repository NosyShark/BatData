<br> Difference in temperature in different parts of bat's bodies and the air temperature around the bats
<br>

<ins>Folders</ins>
<br> Data - raw bat data by Rummel at al.
<br> Code - R code to tidy and plot data
<br> Output - plot in black and white (BatDatBW) and plot in color (BatDatColor) 
<br>

<ins>Terms in R Code</ins>
<br> batdat - Rummel et al.'s raw bat data
<br> battemp - Rummel et al.'s tidy bat data
<br> Tidied the data by removing the "Individual" and "Sampling time" columns and pivoting wide temperature data into long format. 
<br>

<ins>Terms in data file</ins>
<br> Species - 17 species
<br> Individual - each individual has a number - this was removed to tidy data
<br> Pectoralis - temperature of the bat's pectoralis
<br> Biceps - temperature of the bat's biceps
<br> Forearm - temperature of the bat's forearm
<br> Rectal - rectal temperature of bat
<br> Air - air temperature taken while bat's temperature was being measured
<br> Sampling time - how long all measurements took - this was removed to tidy data
<br>

(I have included a plot of the air temperate measured with each bat spp. Though it's not totally beneficial, it provides a better picture of the background for this study.)
